# Making basic blocks

## Multi-sided textures

What about blocks like grass that have different textures on different sides? The following code in the `CopperBlock` class registers three different textures and tells the program which textures belong on the top, sides, and bottom. If we want, we could even make the side textures different (like a furnace or dispenser). You will have to create three texture files matching the names that are being registered. I've made it so that my block has a silver-colored top and bottom. You can add additional `if` statements if you would like the other sides to have different colors as well. The `meta` parameters can be used to alter which textures that are returned (such as how logs face differently based on their angle of placement).

To start off, lets create some variables to store our copper block side textures.

```java
//Creating our icon variables
private IIcon topIcon;
private IIcon sideIcon;
private IIcon botIcon;
```
