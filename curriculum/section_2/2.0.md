>Anytime you copy Java code in this section, be sure to match ALL capitalization, punctuation, and spacing.

In the Minecraft source code, just about everything is represented as a class. There's a class for a diamond pickaxe, for an iron ore, and all other blocks and items. These classes tell what a block (or item) should look like, how it should behave, as well as where it spawns or how it can be crafted. By creating our own classes, we can add our own blocks and items to the game. Let's say that we wanted to make a new type of block. Minecraft already has a `Block` class that defines what a block is in the game (all blocks can be broken and have a texture, for example). We can _extend_ the existing `Block` class and make our own new block. It will have all the normal properties of a block but we can set our own texture, hardness, and sound.

For this lesson, we're going to create a new resource in Minecraft: copper. We'll have to make copper ore, copper ingots, copper tools, and all the other items associated with it (think of the tools and other items made from iron or diamond).
