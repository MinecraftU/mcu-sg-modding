# Making basic blocks

First, open up the IntelliJ project that was created when you ran the gradle builds. Then, you should create a new class called `CopperBlock` by right-clicking on the package and choosing _Create new class_. Name it `CopperBlock` and press OK. The file that opens up will have code almost matching what I've written below. You should add the lines with comments (use `//` to make a comment in Java) after them so that it matches exactly. Note: if you add `extends Block` first, you can press `Alt-Enter` on top of the error and IntelliJ will offer to add the import for you. Be sure that any imports are of the form `net.minecraft.something`.

```java
package com.example.coppermod;

import net.minecraft.block.Block; //Add this line

public class CopperBlock extends Block //Add the second half of this line
{

}
```
