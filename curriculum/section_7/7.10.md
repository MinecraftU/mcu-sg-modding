# Creating crops

We are almost done! Lets add our class variables to the CopperMod.java class. This will also fix the `CopperMod.blueberry` and `CopperMod.blueberryBlock` errors in our previously made classes.

```java
public static BlockBlueberry blueberryBlock;
public static ItemBlueberry blueberry;
```
