# Creating crops

In this section we will create custom crop blocks like wheat. To start off create a new class for our crop. We will inherit from the Minecraft `BlockCrops` class.

```java
package com.example.coppermod;

import net.minecraft.block.BlockCrops;

public class BlockBlueberry extends BlockCrops {

}
```
