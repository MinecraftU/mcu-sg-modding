# Creating crops

Alright, that is for the textures. Now we will program how much items our crop will drop upon harvesting. We will program it to behave like how the wheat crop drops its items. Only when the crop is fully grown, the growth stage is >= 7, then we will drop extra blueberry seeds.

```java
@Override
public ArrayList<ItemStack> getDrops(World world, int x, int y, int z, int meta, int fortune) {
    ArrayList<ItemStack> drops = new ArrayList<ItemStack>();
    drops.add(new ItemStack(CopperMod.blueberry));

    if (meta >= 7)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3+fortune; ++i)
        {
            if(world.rand.nextInt(10) <= meta)
            {
                drops.add(new ItemStack(CopperMod.blueberry));
            }
        }
    }
    return drops;
}
```

You may notice that `CopperMod.blueberry` is red. That is fine for now since we will create our blueberry item in an upcoming step. However, you do need to add the following import lines.

```java
import net.minecraft.item.ItemStack;
import net.minecraft.world.World;
import java.util.ArrayList;
```
