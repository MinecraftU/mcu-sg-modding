# Creating crops

Lets now focus writing the code for the crop textures. Crops are special in that they have 8 separate growth stages. So that means that we need to create an array to store our textures.

Add the following code inside of the `BlockBlueberry` class.

```java
@SideOnly(Side.CLIENT)
protected IIcon[] iIcon;
```

You will also need to add the following import lines at the top of the class.

```java
import cpw.mods.fml.relauncher.Side;
import cpw.mods.fml.relauncher.SideOnly;
import net.minecraft.util.IIcon;
```
