# Creating crops

Now lets register our block and item with Minecraft.

```java
blueberryBlock = new BlockBlueberry();
GameRegistry.registerBlock(blueberryBlock, MODID + "_" + blueberryBlock.getUnlocalizedName());
blueberry = new ItemBlueberry();
GameRegistry.registerItem(blueberry, MODID + "_" + blueberry.getUnlocalizedName());
```

You should be able to launch Minecraft and test our your new blueberry crop.
