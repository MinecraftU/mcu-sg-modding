# Creating crops

Since a blueberries are both food and seeds, we will extend from the `ItemSeedFood` class.

```java
package com.example.coppermod;

import net.minecraft.item.ItemSeedFood;

public class ItemBlueberry extends ItemSeedFood {

}
```

We will get a red line indicating that we need to add a constructor, so we'll do that in the next step.
