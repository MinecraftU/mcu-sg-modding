# Generate your ore

The next step is to add the methods that will allows us to generate our ore in each Minecraft dimension. For now we will just generate our ore on the surface.

```java
private void generateEnd(World world, Random random, int x, int z)
{
    // add a call here to spawn in the End
}

private void generateNether(World world, Random random, int x, int z)
{
    // add a call here to spawn in the Nether
}

private void generateSurface(World world, Random random, int x, int z)
{
    this.addOreSpawn(CopperMod.copperOre, world, random, x, z, 16, 16, 16, 128, 15, 160);
}
```

You may have an red line for `CopperMod.copperOre`. If you do, then go ahead and create class for our copper ore block, following the steps in section 2. You also wonder what the numbers like 16, 128, 15, 160 mean. We will cover that in the next step.
