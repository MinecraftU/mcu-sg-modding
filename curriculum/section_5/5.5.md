# Generate your ore

The very last step is to register the `OreManager` class with Minecraft. Go ahead and add these lines to your `CopperMod` class with all your other registration code.

```java
OreManager om = new OreManager();
GameRegistry.registerWorldGenerator(om, 0); //Integer determines when generation code
// runs (0 = normal). Use higher numbers to run later
```
