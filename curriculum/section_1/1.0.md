# Brief introduction to classes and methods

Before we dive into the Minecraft environment, you should understand what the words _class_ and _method_ mean in Java. At its most basic, a _class_ represents a real-world object by using code. Classes can have both state and behavior. In other words, they both store information and do something with that information. For example, in a spaceship game you may have a spaceship class that holds the position and health of the player, and it may move around space and fire blasters.
