# Brief introduction to classes and methods

## Defining a new class

At the beginning of this section, you read that classes have both state and behavior. So far, we've only created a class with behavior (a method that sums two numbers). Let's create a class that also contains information. Go ahead and create a new class called `Rectangle` just as you created the class called `Main`.  Then let's give it some properties: length, width, perimeter, area.

```java
public class Rectangle {
    public int length;
    public int width;
    public int perimeter, area;

    public Rectangle(int l, int w) {
        this.length = l;
        this.width = w;
        this.perimeter = length*2 + width*2;
        this.area = length * width;
    }

}
```  

The only new part here, is the `public Rectangle(int l, int w)` method.  This method is called the `Constructor` and will be used to _instantiate_ our object in our next section.
