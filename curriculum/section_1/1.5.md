# Brief introduction to classes and methods

## Creating an object from a class

Now that a `Rectangle` class has been defined, we can _instantiate_ a `Rectangle` _object_ in our main. To _instantiate_ an object means to create an _instance_ from a class. Imagine that our class is the blueprint for constructing a particular model of car, and that objects are the actual cars that are being driven. All of these cars behave the same way and contain the same types of information (think speed, color, license plate).  Now that we have our Rectangle blueprint, we can make a couple Rectangle objects with different sizes.

In your `Main` class, in the `main` method, create a few Rectangle objects by calling the Rectangle constructor, passing in a width and a height.  We'll make the first one a 2x3 Rectangle and the second a 3x4 Rectangle.  We'll also want to print out the area and perimeter.  Your code should look like this:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {    
    Rectangle rect1 = new Rectangle(2,3);
    Rectangle rect2 = new Rectangle(3,4);

    System.out.println("Area of rect1: " + rect1.area);
    System.out.println("Perimeter of rect1: " + rect1.perimeter);
    System.out.println("Area of rect2: " + rect2.area);
    System.out.println("Perimeter of rect2: " + rect2.perimeter);
}
```
