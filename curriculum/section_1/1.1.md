# Brief introduction to classes and methods

## Navigating IntelliJ

Open up IntelliJ using either the shortcut on your desktop, or hitting the Windows key and searching `IntelliJ`.  Choose `Create new project` and give it a name.  We'll be calling ours `JavaReview`.  Once IntelliJ opens, in the top left, you should see a folder icon called `JavaReview` or whatever you named the project.  Double-click it and a sidebar should appear with two options: `JavaReview` and `External Libraries`.  We'll talk about "External Libraries" later, double-click `JavaReview` for now.  You should have a few options appear, including an `out` folder and a `src` folder.
