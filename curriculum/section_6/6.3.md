# Creating foods

Finally, we can quickly and easily add potion effects when our foods are eaten. If we override the `onFoodEaten` method and call the `setPotionEffect` method, we can give the player any potion effect for any duration. Look at the source code of the `Potion` class to know which ID numbers correspond to which potions.

```java
protected void onFoodEaten(ItemStack itemstack, World world, EntityPlayer player)
{
    player.addPotionEffect(new PotionEffect(1, 20, 1));  //potion id, duration, amplifier
}
```

Now that you know the basics of creating foods, pick a couple of fairly complicated foods that require multiple steps and ingredients to make in real life. Some suggestions could be apple pie or a sandwich. Then, recreate the steps in Minecraft! Make new classes that extend `ItemFood` to make the ingredients and recipes (both crafting and smelting!) to simulate the cooking process.
