## Setup

### Installation

1. Install the Java SDK by running the file you downloaded.

2. Run the IntelliJ installer, and follow its instructions. Make sure you have installed the Java SDK before installing IntelliJ, it makes things easier.

3. Make a new folder on the desktop and name it `Minecraft Dev` and drag the `forge` folder into it. The forge folder is a .zip file so we need to extract it (if you don't have an extraction tool we recommend 7-zip). Put the extracted folder into the Minecraft Dev folder.

Note: If you wish, you can rename the extracted `forge` folder to whatever you want your mod to be called, e.g. from `forge` to `DiamondCutter`. Keep the Forge zip file in case you want to start a fresh mod.

The next page will describe the setup for a Windows machine. If you are using a MAC, the setup instructions will be shown after the Windows setup.
