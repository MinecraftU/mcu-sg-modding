## Setup

### Testing

1. On the top left, double click the folder icon (the name of your folder should be next to it).

2. Double-click the folders: src > main > java > com.example.examplemod

3. There should be an `ExampleMod` class (blue circle with the letter 'c' in it) and if you double-click it you should see the following code (you might have to change `preInit` to `init` and `FMLPreInitializationEvent` to `FMLInitializationEvent`):
    ```java
    package com.example.examplemod;

    import net.minecraft.init.Blocks;
    import cpw.mods.fml.common.Mod;
    import cpw.mods.fml.common.Mod.EventHandler;
    import cpw.mods.fml.common.event.FMLInitializationEvent;

    @Mod(modid = ExampleMod.MODID, version = ExampleMod.VERSION)
    public class ExampleMod
    {
        public static final String MODID = "examplemod";
        public static final String VERSION = "1.0";

        @EventHandler
        public void init(FMLInitializationEvent event)
        {
    		// some example code
            System.out.println("DIRT BLOCK >> "+Blocks.dirt.getUnlocalizedName());
        }
    }
    ```

4. Left-click on `ExampleMod` and press `Shift + F6`. Change the name to something that you like and click `Refactor`. This will change all instances of `ExampleMod` to a mod name of your choice. For our examples, we use `CopperMod` since our mod adds copper to the game. We'll also have to change the `MODID` and `VERSION` to what we want. You can delete the example `println` statement if you wish.

5. If this is your first IntelliJ project, or you don't have an SDK setup, you will need to do so now. 
    * Press `ctrl + shift + alt + s` 
    * In the `Project SDK` section click `New...` and click `JDK`
    * A _Select Home Directory for JDK_ window will appear.  Navigate to your `Java` folder which by default should be in `C:\ > Program Files > Java`  Click the jdk folder and hit `OK`
