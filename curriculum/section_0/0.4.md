## Setup

### Troubleshooting:

The most common error is the build failing with a message saying "JAVA_HOME does not point to JDK":

1. Click start  
2. Right-click Computer  (for Windows 8 open up file explorer and right-click "This PC")  
3. Click properties  
4. On the left side click advanced system settings  
5. At the bottom of the pop-up, click Environment Variables  
6. Under system variables (second section of pop-up) click new  
7. Name it JAVA_HOME  
8. The value should point to your JDK 7 folder (something like "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_51")  
9. Click ok  
10. Close and re-open command prompt and run the command again.
