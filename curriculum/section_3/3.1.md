# Making basic items

Just as we did with our `CopperBlock` class, we can also add a constructor and give some properties to our `CopperIngot`.

```java
public CopperIngot()
{
    this.setUnlocalizedName("copper_ingot");
    this.setCreativeTab(CreativeTabs.tabMaterials);
    this.setTextureName("coppermod:copper_ingot");
}
```
