# Making basic items

## On-click effects
There are two methods that are called when the player right-clicks while holding an item. `onItemUse` is called when the player is targeting a block in range (ie. the block has the black wireframe around it), while `onItemRightClick` is called regardless of what the player is targeting (ie. even if they are looking at the sky).

`onItemUse` gives us several parameters that we can use to make _something_ happen when an item is used.

```java
@Override
public boolean onItemUse(ItemStack itemstack, EntityPlayer player, World world, int p_77648_4_, int p_77648_5_, 
int p_77648_6_, int p_77648_7_, float p_77648_8_, float p_77648_9_, float p_77648_10_)
{
    return false;
}
```

```java
`onItemRightClick` is a bit more general and primitive. There are fewer arguments given to us,
  @Override
public ItemStack onItemRightClick(ItemStack itemstack, World world, EntityPlayer player)
{
    return itemstack;
}
```
