## Making the tool class

Now go ahead and create the `ItemCopperPickaxe` class and extend from the `ItemPickaxe` class.

```java
package com.example.coppermod;

import net.minecraft.item.ItemPickaxe;

public class ItemCopperPickaxe extends ItemPickaxe {
    
}
```

We will get an error stating since we have not added our constructor. Lets add one in the next step.
