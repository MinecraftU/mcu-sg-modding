# Creating foods

Making the crafting recipe for a food is just like for any other item. A recipe is required to make the tortilla from wheat, and then make the taco from tortilla and steak.

```java
GameRegistry.addShapedRecipe(new ItemStack(itemTortilla), "xx ", "xx ", "   ", 'x', Items.wheat);
```

```
