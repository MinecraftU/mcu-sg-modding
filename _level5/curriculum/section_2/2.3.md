# Making basic blocks

However, simply making a new class in our project is not enough. To actually add our block into the game, we need to register it with Minecraft Forge. Open the `CopperMod` class from the left side of the screen (it might still be called `ExampleMod` initially; just rename it to `CopperMod` if so). Add the variable declaration line and the `registerBlock` line shown below. The second argument of `registerBlock` sets up the name of the block as "_modid_\__blockname_" and lets us use the same code to create a standardized naming system for all of our blocks. In addition, by using our _MODID_ in the names of our blocks, we can make sure there won't be any overlaps with any other mods we may want to add.

```java
public static CopperBlock copperBlock;  //static variable declaration

@EventHandler
public void init(FMLInitializationEvent event)
{
    copperBlock = new CopperBlock(Material.iron);
    GameRegistry.registerBlock(copperBlock, MODID + "_" + copperBlock.getUnlocalizedName());
}
```

This block of code registers our newly-created block with the game. Again, `MODID + "_" + copperBlock.getUnlocalizedName()` creates a unique name based on our `MODID`, so that our blocks (or items) will not conflict with other mods.
