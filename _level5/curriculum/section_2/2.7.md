## Adding a texture to a block

To add our texture to our block, we first need to create the folder that will hold our textures. The full path is `src/main/resources/assets/coppermod/textures/blocks`. Start at the `resources` folder (it should already exist) and create one folder after another until you get down to the final one, `blocks`. Open up Paint (or another image-editing program) and create a new empty canvas with a square resolution. Most Minecraft textures are 16x16 but you could also try 32x32 or 64x64. Take a few minutes and make your own texture!

For right now, the block will have the same texture on all six sides like cobblestone or obsidian. Name the texture `copper_block` and save it as a `.png` in the `blocks` folder. After your texture has been saved, run Minecraft. Now check out the texture of your block!
