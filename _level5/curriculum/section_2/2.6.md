# Making basic blocks

To actually launch our modded Minecraft, run the project by clicking on the green arrow at the top of the IDE. Make a new creative world and try placing your block on the ground. It should be under the normal `Blocks` tab at the very bottom and will be called `tile.copper_block.name`. The coloring should be a purple and black checkerboard, the default color scheme when a texture is not specified. Even though we said the texture file's name should be `copper_block` in the code, Minecraft can't find the texture file because we haven't made one!
