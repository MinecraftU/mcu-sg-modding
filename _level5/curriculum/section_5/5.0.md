# Generate your ore

In this section, we will now create our ore generator. This will allow Minecraft to generate our copper ore in the Overworld, Nether, or End dimensions. To get started, create a class named `OreManager` and instead of typing `extend`, type in `implements IWorldGenerator`. This is necessary for Minecraft to know which method to call for generating our ore. 

```java
package com.example.coppermod;

import cpw.mods.fml.common.IWorldGenerator;

public class OreManager implements IWorldGenerator {
    
}
```

You may get an error, and thats fine for now. Continue to the next steps to finish building the class.
