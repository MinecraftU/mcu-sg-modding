# Making basic items

We'll also need to register our item with the game using the `registerItem` function. You should create a static `copperIngot` variable in `CopperMod` class just as we did with our static `copperBlock` variable.

```java
copperIngot = new CopperIngot();    //initializing the variable you should declare in the class
GameRegistry.registerItem(copperIngot, MODID + "_" + copperIngot.getUnlocalizedName());
```
