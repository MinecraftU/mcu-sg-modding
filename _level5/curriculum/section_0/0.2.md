## Setup

### Getting started for Windows

1. Hold shift and right click inside the folder you renamed. Click on `Open command window here`. Then type `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace --refresh-dependencies` and press `Enter`. This will download the Minecraft source code and decompile it so we can work with it to make our mod.

2. Once you get `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` type `gradlew idea` and press `Enter`.

3. After you get `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` again, run IntelliJ (the installation should have put a shortcut on your desktop).  You most likely won't have any setting to import (click `ok`).  Unless you have coding experience and have preferences, click `Skip All and Set Defaults`.

4. On the pop-up screen, select `Open` and navigate to the folder you renamed.

5. Find the file with the IntelliJ icon - it should be (Your_Folder_Name.ipr) and open it.
