# Adding custom drops and recipes

On a side note, the _damage values_ of items often hold extra information (also called data) about the block. For example, all the colors of wool are actually the same type of block. They're rendered differently based on the value of their damage value. We can use this data value in our recipes to alter what kinds of wool, clay, or wood are required.

```java
// What do you think this smelting recipe does?
ItemStack woolStackBlack = new ItemStack(Blocks.wool);
ItemStack woolStackOrange = new ItemStack(Blocks.wool);
woolStackBlack.setItemDamage(15);
woolStackOrange.setItemDamage(1);
GameRegistry.addSmelting(woolStackBlack, woolStackOrange, 0.1f);
```
