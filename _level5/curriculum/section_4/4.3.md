## Making new crafting recipes
>The function calls that create new recipes will go in your main mod class

Now we need to make our new blocks and items useful by creating some recipes! There are two types of recipes we can create: shapeless and shaped. Shapeless recipes (such as making wooden planks from wood) don't require the items to be in any specific orientation to work. Shaped recipes (such as making a pickaxe or shovel) require blocks to be in specific locations for the recipe to function.

We simply use the `addShaplessRecipe` and `addShapedRecipe` function calls to register our recipes with the game. The calls will go in your main mod class, and you will need to import the `ItemStack` and `Items` classes to use them (IntelliJ will prompt you for them when you use them).
