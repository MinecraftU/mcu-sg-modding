# Adding custom drops and recipes

What if we wanted to make our block drop several ingots when broken? It generally takes 9 ingots to make a block, so let's use the `quantityDropped` method to tell our `CopperBlock` to drop 9 ingots when it is mined. The following method declaration should go in your `CopperBlock` class.

```java
public int quantityDropped(Random rand)
{
    return 9;
}
```
