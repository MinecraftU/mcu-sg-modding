# Adding custom drops and recipes

Another way we could do this is by dropping a random amount of ingots when the block breaks. `rand` is a `Random` object that we could use to add randomness to our drops. For example, we could specify that we want a random number of ingots between 2 and 5 to drop when a block is broken by using the `nextInt` method to get a random number.

```java
public int quantityDropped(Random rand)
{
    return 2 + rand.nextInt(3); //random between 2 and 5
}
```
